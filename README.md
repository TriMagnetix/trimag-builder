# trimag builder

a framework for building logic gates for trimagnetix systems.

## TODO

### mesh library

- [x] add coordinates to graph
- [x] export as nmesh
- [x] export as neutral mesh
- [ ] extrude
- [ ] fix binary image
- [ ] support different regions in nmesh export
- [ ] render mesh
- [ ] support periodic nodes

### simulation automation

- [ ] define pinned regions and directions
- [ ] create nmag script
- [ ] run simulations
- [ ] visualize results
