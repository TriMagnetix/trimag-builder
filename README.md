# trimag builder

a framework for building logic gates for trimagnetix systems.

## TODO

### mesh library

- [x] add coordinates to graph
- [x] export as nmesh
- [x] export as neutral mesh
- [x] extrude
- [x] fix binary image
- [x] support different regions in nmesh export
- [x] render mesh
- [x] support periodic nodes

### simulation automation

- [ ] mesh to nmesh format
- [ ] setup backend
- [ ] define pinned regions and directions
- [ ] create nmag script
- [ ] run simulations
- [ ] visualize results

### bug fixes

- [x] remove redundant nodes
- [x] smooth edges
